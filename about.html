        <h1>Company Information</h1>
        <p>
          On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to
          Portsea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of
          Sorrento that offers restaurants, cafes, a chemist, a supermarket, a
          butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses
          from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches
          and surf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with
          leather lounge suite overlooking a sun drenched, tree-filled private
          garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay
          relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized bedroom and an amazing bathroom
          complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and
          unwind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy! An undercover BBQ area with
          seating offers plenty of space to stretch out and enjoy that cup of
          freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.
        </p>
        <p>This is the perfect place for a home away from home.</p>
        <h2>Pet friendly</h2>
        <p>We understand that pets are an important part of the family.</p>
        <p>
          We are pet friendly by arrangement - so please talk to us about your
          needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer a fully enclosed backyard, shady trees, water bowls, food
          bowls and a lead if you forget one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only 3 minutes from a leash free beach, an oval close by and if you
          want to sleep in we are happy to take your dog (depending on its size)
          for a walk in the morning.

        <h1>Testimonials</h1>
        <p>
          "So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely
          stay two nights next time!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the
          walks were amazing"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It
          was such a shame we had to drive back to our little flat, which is
          smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being
          spoilt. Thank you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely
          self-contained and very private. We loved it and will return again and
          again."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything.
          We had the best bath ever!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "A few minutes’ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel
          over the shoulder - can't think of anything better except that
          wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me
          stay forever!"
